                Storytelling has been the human strategy to pass down information,
                to ensure that information is remembered, and to inspire action to keep humanity alive.
            </p>

            <p class="pb-4">
                Storytelling is built into how we think — so much so that our brains respond to, remember, 
                and recall stories better than any other method of sharing information like listing out facts, or a powerpoint presentation,
                or any other form of sharing information that lacks a narrative structure.
            </p>

            <p class="pb-4">
                Storytelling has the power to hook attention, create trust and connection, forge bonds based in trust,
                and influence the reader's actions long after reading. 
            </p>

            <p class="pb-4">
                Because of that neurochemical dance that happens  in your brains when we read a great story, 
                storytelling becomes a bridge of trust connecting you, your ideal customer, and their decision to buy your service or product. 
            </p>

            <p class="pb-4">
                Whether you send weekly emails, create video content, speak on stages,
                or pay for ads—stories are a great way to stand out, build trust, and inspire action. 
            </p>
            <p class="pb-4 text-orange font-bold">
                And storytelling is a tool every solopreneur should have in their marketing tool box!
