                  It's no secret that the world has become pretty obsessed with AI... 
                </span>
                  everywhere you look, entrepreneurs are asking AI to write their content, develop their marketing strategies, 
                  even walk their dog (I'm sure this is coming)â€¦
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                  And AI can be an incredible tool. 
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                  <span class="font-bold">
                  But if you don't have the skills to take what it gives you and rewrite
                  it in a way that sounds personal, relatable, and real, then it's going to hurt more than it helps.
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                  By 2025, it's predicted that as much as 90% of online content will be written by AI. That means content written for humans by
                  humans will be rare. What is rare will be valued. And what is valued will be read.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                  So while everyone else is turning to AI to grow their business, the way to stand out in this increasingly artificial world is to be relatably and authentically yourself.
                  To be human.
