            A lot of marketing today is the <Underline className="text-orange" text="opposite" /> of what people actually want...

                  Consumers today are smarter than ever and 
                    when we get overly focused on making the sale — 
                    we forget what makes people actually want to buy in the first place.
                    So the question we must ask ourselves is...
                    <span class="font-bold">
                        What makes people actually want to buy?

                <p class="mb-4">
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    People buy when they have a problem they think you can solve... but!
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    In this overcrowded market — <span class="font-bold">
                            you're not the only person who can solve their problem.
                    </span>
                    You're not the only trainer at the gym,
                    not the only business coach online,
                    and you’re definitely not the only Etsy shop selling tiny hats for dogs.

                <p class="mb-4">
                    When so many businesses are selling the same thing, with the same features, and same benefits…
                    <Underline className="text-orange" text="How are you supposed to stand out?" />
