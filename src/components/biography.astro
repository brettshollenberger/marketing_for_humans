          Who Teaches Marketing For Humans?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Marketing For Humans is led by Nadia Ouazzi, a White House intern,
          turned Googler, turned comedy writer, turned copywriter and marketing
          strategist.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Known to many
          <span class="italic"> (but acknowledged by none)</span>
          as a total genius, model, and most brilliant mind of the 21st century,
          Nadia’s mission in life is to bring authenticity and fun back into the
          work we do.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Her unconventional (but story worthy) career path has led to her an
          authentic, feel-good approach to marketing, sales, and life — an
          approach that feels enjoyably, hilariously, and relatably human.
